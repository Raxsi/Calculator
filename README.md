# Visual C++ / MFC Calculator

This project is a basic calculator application built using **Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC)** in **Visual C++**. It supports simple arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The purpose of this project is to explore MFC programming concepts and develop good coding techniques.

## Features

- **Simple Arithmetic Operations**: 
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- **Basic Calculator Interface**:
  - Supports user input through buttons and displays results in a single edit box.
  - Multiple operations can be performed in sequence.
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Microsoft Visual Studio** with **MFC support**.

### Building and Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mfc-calculator.git
### Installation and Setup

1. **Open the solution file** (`.sln`) in **Microsoft Visual Studio**.
2. **Make sure MFC is installed** as part of your Visual Studio installation.
   - If MFC is not installed, go to **Tools > Get Tools and Features**.
   - Check the **Desktop development with C++** workload and install it.
3. **Build and run the project** using either the `Debug` or `Release` configuration.

### Running the Calculator

Once the project is built, launch the application. Use the calculator interface to enter numbers and operations by clicking the respective buttons. The result will be displayed in the single edit box.

## Usage

The calculator allows users to perform sequential arithmetic operations. Simply input numbers and operations using the buttons, and press `=` to compute the result.

## Example Calculations
### Test 1:
3 + 4 - 2 = 5 + 7 = 12
### Test 2:
7 - 3 * 5 / 2 + 3 = 2.5
### Test 3:
6 / 5 * 2 - 4 * 3 = -9.6

## Technologies Used

- **Visual C++**: For building the desktop application.
- **Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC)**: To handle the UI and events.
- **Windows API**: For integrating with Windows' native controls and events.

## Key Concepts

### MFC Programming:
- Understanding dialog-based applications and UI elements like buttons and edit controls.
- Handling button clicks and updating UI elements, like the edit box, with results.
